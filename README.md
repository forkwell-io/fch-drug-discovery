# Forkwell Coronavirus Hack: Drug Discovery
<hr>

## Introduction
<div style="text-align: justify">
Drug development is generally arduous, costly, and the success rate is dauntingly low. Thus, the identification of drug-target interactions (DTIs) has become a crucial step in early stages of drug discovery. Experimental confirmation of new DTIs is not an easy task, as in vitro experiments are laborious and time-consuming. Even if a confirmed DTI has been used for developing a new drug, the approval for human use of such new drugs can take many years and estimated cost may run over a billion US dollars (Dimasi et al., 2003). Hence, we developed a deep learning model to predict the pK<sub>d</sub> of drug-target pair to make a fast scan through currently approved drugs to discover candidate drugs for nCoV-19. Validating the readily available and approved drugs is more practical to curb the harsh situation in the meantime of waiting for development of de novo drugs.

## Challenges
- pyrx takes so long to check even one DTBA
- the sdf files generated using rdkit is different from the ones from online, yielding different results
- no domain knowledge XD
- all the works are not done on local machine, so we might write wrongly the file paths in our submission
